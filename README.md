First of all, fork this repository so that you can have your own copy on your profile. 

In the "HandsOn exercises" folder you can find the python scripts for the hands on session of 02/11, fully commented.
In the "Homework" folder you can play with git in order to track the progress (PSoC and Python code) of the final exercise that I will assign to you. It's not mandatory but it can help you solidifying the information acquired during the lesson, as well as getting more comfortable with PyQt5.
